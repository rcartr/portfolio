# My Portfolio 2.0

During the ElevenFifty Academy web development bootcamp we created a portfolio page to display some of the projects we had worked on up to that point. It was a relatively simple HTML + CSS page with an introduction to Bootstrap styling. Moving on from this point in the course, we began to use and learn React and started utilizing some more advanced methods of coding and development, including more advanced use of styling libraries. The old portfolio page no longer seemed an adequate reflection of my skills.

Now that I have graduated from the course and set out on my new career path in the tech industry, I wanted to update my portfolio accordingly and be able to add more advanced projects to it as I tackle them. This portfolio will be an evolving project that I continue to work on for self development and update as needed.
